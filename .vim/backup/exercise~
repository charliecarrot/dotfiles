# Perl Power! - Michael Schilli
# Exercise 1.4

# It is possible to pass scalars and
# an array to a function by value:
# for this, the array must be the last
# parameter. Write a perl function
# that upon the following call ->

$a = 1;
$b = 2;
@c = (3, 4, 5);

func($a, $b, @c);

sub func
{
	my ($a, $b, @c) = 
}
