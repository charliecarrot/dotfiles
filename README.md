My Dotfiles
===========

Keeping my app configuration files on github makes it easy to import the
files onto a new system as needed. 

* Vim

A powerful keyboard editor that minimizes key chords by using
context-sensitive commands. This editor allows you to stay away
from the mouse and stay centered on the home keys as much as possible.

* tmux

This terminal app lets you view multiple multiple terminal sessions through
panes, which are movable around the screen using keyboard shortcuts.
